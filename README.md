This is a Sinatra project based on a book by Andy Hunt, "Pragmatic Thinking & Learning: Refactor Your Wetware." 

The following passage from Hunt's book distills what I am trying to create in my Sinatra project:

“... You create a new page by first creating a link to it using a *WikiWord*. … Once you place a *WikiWord* on a page, it will automatically become hyper-linked to the wiki page with that name. If one does not yet exist, then the first time you click it, you’ll be given a blank page and the opportunity to fill it in. This makes it very easy and natural to create new pages.”
